## context
Please don't judge me too hard — I don't claim to be a masterful front-end dev :)



## project setup
I don't know why you'd try to run my personal site, but go ahead.
I feel like the auto-generated instructions below are.. wrong? 
I've been using the Vue UI through yarn. Unsure if NPM is correct. Try anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

```
npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

#### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

#### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

#### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
